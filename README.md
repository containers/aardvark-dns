# aardvark-dns

Aardvark-dns is an authoritative dns server for `A/AAAA` container records. It can forward other requests
to configured resolvers.

Read more about configuration in `src/backend/mod.rs`. It is mostly intended to be used with
[Netavark](https://github.com/containers/netavark/) which will launch it automatically if both are
installed.

### MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)

v1.76

We test that Netavark can be build on this Rust version and on some newer versions.
All newer versions should also build, and if they do not, the issue should be
reported and will be fixed. Older versions are not guaranteed to build and issues
will not be fixed.

### Build

```console
make
```

### Run Example

```console
RUST_LOG=trace ./bin/aardvark-dns --config src/test/config/podman/ --port 5533 run
```

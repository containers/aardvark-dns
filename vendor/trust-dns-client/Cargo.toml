description = "Trust-DNS is a safe and secure DNS library. This is the Client library with DNSec support.\n DNSSec with NSEC validation for negative records, is complete. The client supports\n dynamic DNS with SIG0 authenticated requests, implementing easy to use high level\n funtions. Trust-DNS is based on the Tokio and Futures libraries, which means\n it should be easily integrated into other software that also use those\n libraries.\n"
